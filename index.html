        <h3>How to Solve a Rubik's Cube:</h3>
        <p>A lot of people think they don't have what it takes to solve a Rubik's Cube. They couldn't be more wrong! It's all about perspective. The way I learned how to solve a Rubik's cube was to memorize algorithms, but at the time, I didn't truly understand all of it. After practice, I started to notice the patterns, and eventually I realized I could solve it no matter how it was given to me in the first place.</p>
        <p>You will still need algorithms, but it's easier to understand these algorithms if you know what you're solving for. I'll give you a quick tip: it's not one face color at a time! I break it down to three main steps: bottom face and row, middle row, and top row and face. Let's take a closer look at the algorithms only in reference to which part of the cube for which we're trying to solve.</p>

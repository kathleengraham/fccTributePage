# freeCodeCamp: TributePage

## Tests Passing

This Tribute Page passes the tests provided in freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification for project 1.

## Inspiration

I chose to make a tribute page for the Rubik's Cube because it has always been one of my favorite misunderstood things. A lot of people think it's so hard for the average person to solve, but I think that anyone can solve it with the right perspective.

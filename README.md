The script for the test suite has been included so that others can take a closer look at the details of each test while on the tribute page.

## Inspiration

I chose to make a tribute page for the Rubik's Cube because it has always been one of my favorite misunderstood things. A lot of people think it's so hard for the average person to solve, but I think that anyone can solve it with the right perspective.
